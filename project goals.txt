Create an applet/spreadsheet that can:
When given the BBYC course number and wind direction
Return the course buoys and headings/wind angles to/from each

Extra:
Have the ability to add extra/custom courses
recommend sail (given sail inventory)


Data that I have:
Course maps
Buoy names/numbers, locations/GPS positions

one option for data input could be to take a csv or similar with course data (makes it transferrable)


GPS integration (ping start)
manual gps entry


for rnzys, add division select and populate courses depending on division

TODO:
- option to enter the upwind angle of your boat (maybe encorporate as part of sail selection stuff)
    could then indicate when a leg is considered upwind (ie you wont be able to sail direct)
