Create an applet/spreadsheet that can:
When given the BBYC course number and wind direction
Give me the course buoys and headings/wind angles to/from each

Extra:
Have the ability to add extra/custom courses
recommend sail (given sail inventory)


Data that I have:
Course maps
Buoy names/numbers, locations/GPS positions

one option for data input could be to take a csv or similar with course data (makes it transferrable)
